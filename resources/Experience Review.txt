========= DESIGN/IMPLEMENTATION =========
Most of our model and visitor implementations were as intended and did not require any changes.
Given another opportunity to change the code, we still would have kept the model and the
visitors for the model exactly the same. However, we would change our controller to deal
with action listeners and giving the shapes to the views. Currently, the views have a model
adapter that restricts mutation for the view and the view also implements ActionListener
and ItemListener. The better option would be to make the controller do all of that. The code
given to us taught us how exactly to work with implementing adapters with only documentation.
This showed how important the specifics of documentation is to others, not just to the code writer.
We did not get any response from our customers, so we presume our customers did run into big issues
with our design.

========= PROVIDER EXPERIENCE =========
Our providers provided us with our code very early on without request. However, upon needing
more essential parts of the view, we sent an email to all three of their members requesting
the code on Thursday, only to receive the code on Saturday. This greatly took away from the
time we could work on the assignment. Emailing them again for bugs at a later time had a
quicker response with fairly fast bug fixes.
